# 调试器

Ring 编译器提供了一个命令行交互式调试器。

可以通过一下命令运行调试器：

```bash
    ring rdb <input-file>

    
    ring rdb ./test/060-std-package-debug/debug-000.ring
```

## 1. 调试器的基本命令

调试器支持以下命令：


### help(?) [command]

Without argument, print the list of available commands. With a command as argument, print help about that command. 


### clear

### quit(q)

Quit from the debugger. The program being executed is aborted.


### global

Print the global variables.


### local

Print the local variables.

### bt

Print a stack trace, with the most recent frame at the top.


### cont(c)

Continue execution, only stop when a breakpoint is encountered.


### step over(n)

- Executes the current line of code and moves to the next line.
- Does not enter any functions or methods called on the current line.
- Can be used to quickly navigate through code and see the results of specific actions.

### step into(i)

- Enters the current function or method and executes it line by line.
- Allows you to inspect the code execution process in detail.
- Can be useful for debugging complex code or understanding the flow of execution.

### step out(o)

- Exits the current function or method and returns to the caller.
- Useful for quickly moving out of nested code blocks or functions.
- Can also be used to skip over large sections of code that are not of interest.


### break set <line-number>

Set a breakpoint at *line-number*.

### break unset <line-number>

Unset a breakpoint at *line-number*.

### break list

List all the breakpoints.


### break clear

Clear all the breakpoints.
